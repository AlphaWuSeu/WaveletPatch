# WaveletPatch
This is the code for Spatial-enhanced Multi-level Wavelet Patching in Vision Transformers

Our paper is proposing a Spatial-enhanced Multi-level Wavelet Patching module to replace the spatial domain patching in ViT, so we will make direct improvements in the original code of several different networks, which can be seen:

#ViT
The foundational code for our ViT varient is derived from the repository "vision-transformer-pytorch" by ssuncheol. We appreciate their contribution to the open-source community. Our adaptation involves the integration of our own WaveletPatch unit, resulting in the creation of the SMWP ViT.
